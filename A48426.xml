            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A BOOK OF KNOWLEDGE. <hi>Of</hi> GAUGING.</head>
            <p>THIS being a business which concerns every Man who Sells, and Buys such Liquors as are liable to pay Duty to the Queen, as well as otherwise, I shall endeavour to make it as plain as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Nature of the Thing will allow.</p>
            <p>It is common for every Man who buys any Liquors, to examine the Quality of it, but is obliged to take the Sellers Word for the Quantity, by reason he is not so competent a Judge therein, as he may be of the other: But without doubt every Man is desirous to know how much, as well as what he has bought; and questionless, sometimes a Man Pays for more than he has delivered to him, tho' at the same time he pays for no more than what he has bought, and ought to have deliver'd to him.</p>
            <p>To prevent such Inconveniences or Losses, it is proper the Buyer as well as the Seller, should understand how to <hi>Measure</hi> or <hi>Gauge</hi> such Quantities as they buy in the Cask; and because every Man is not so well vers'd in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61011:4"/> Arithmetick as the Art of Gauging requires, I shall set down such easy Rules as may sute the meanest Capacity, and I shall begin with a Common Brewer.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> How a common Brewer may Gauge his own Worts in the Cooler, or Back, so that he may know his Charge.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> YOU are to find the Area, or what quantity your Cooler, or Back holds upon one Inch in depth, which must be found in manner following.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Suppose a Square Cooler be in length 206 Inches, and 3 tenth parts of an Inch, and in breadth 153 Inches, and 2 tenth parts of an Inch, you must Multiply 206.3 the Length of the Cooler by 153.2 the Breadth, and the Product divide by 282, or Multiply by .00355, and the Quotient, if you Divide, or the Product, if you Multiply, is how many Gallons of Worts, your Back holds upon every Inch in Depth. Now having found the Area of your Cooler, or the Content upon one Inch in Depth, the greatest part of the work is done, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part being only to Multiply that Area by the Inches and Parts, the Back is in depth of Liquor, and the Product is the Number of Gallons and Parts the Cooler has in it.</p>

                  <p>You must apply your Line or Rule to the Length of the Oval, and set down how many Inches and Parts it is, and in like manner to the Breadth, then add them together, and take half the Sum for the Mean Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the which you must Multiply, or Divide, as in the Round Cooler, and the Quotient or Product is the thing required.</p>
                  <p>By reason some Men will reckon it too tedious, and others may not rightly apprehend the former Rules, I shall set down a Table, by which you may by Inspection (having taken the Dimensions by the Rule) find the Area, and Content of a Tun or Back.</p>
                  <p>In the City of <hi>London</hi> the common Brewers Backs are extraordinary large, and it would be too tedious to find how many Gallons a Tun or Cooler holds, the Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions being taken in Inches in Length and Breadth, therefore I shall here compose a Table by which you may know how many Barrels, Kilderkins, Firkins, Gallons, Pottles <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Back or Tun holds upon one Inch deep, from one Foot, to 10 Foot Square.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> How Victualers may know whether they have their right Measure of Drink from the Brewer, and whether their Casks be false or true?</head>
               <p>FOR those who understand Figures, I shall insert an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule, whereby they shall easily Discover a Fraud, if there be such, and for those who do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Figuring, (or suppose they be illiterate) shall exactly know what is in their Butts, Hogsheads, Barrels▪ Kilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, or Firkins, and how much is wanting of what they should have▪ and that in the Plainest and easiest Method imaginable.</p>
               <p>I shall first begin with him who understands Figures; for tho' he has Learned no further than <hi>Multiplication,</hi> he is sufficiently qualify'd for this.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61011:7"/>
               <p>Suppose he was to Gauge a Barrel of Beer, he is first to put his Rule in at the Bong, downright, and observe how many Inches and Parts the Inside of the Bong Cuts on the Rule and Insert it on Paper, then apply a Line to the Head in manner following, you are to find the Center of the Head by a pair of Compasses, then extend your Line from one side of the Circle to the other, crossing the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and how many Inches and Parts that is, set down; likewise the Inches must be distinguished from the Parts by a prick betwixt the number of Inches, and the number of Parts.</p>
               <p>When you have done according to the foregoing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, you must Subduct the Inches and Parts, the Head is in Diameter, from the Bong Diameter, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder you must Multiply by .7, and that Product you must add to the Head Diameter, placing the Head Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter one place towards the Left-hand, further than the Product, as you may see in the following Example.</p>

                  <p>The Content of this Cask is 35 Gallons, and almost an half. Always observe to prick off so many Figures to the Right-hand in the Product, as there is Figures or decimal Parts prickt off in both Multiplicator and Multiplicand, and those Figures to the Left-hand of the prick is the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Gallons, and the rest is only so many parts of a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon as you may see in the Direction to a common Brewer.</p>
                  <p>This Rule in finding the Content must be used in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, Kilderkins, Firkins, Hogsheads and Butts; but to ease you of all this Trouble of <hi>Multiplication,</hi> I shall hereafter insert a Table which will be very useful and easy for you.</p>
                  <p>In the next place I shall direct how any Man that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands nothing of Figures, shall Gauge his own Drink, by the help of nothing but a Rod of Inches and Quarters, and a Cork, ballanced with a piece of Lead at the end of it, so much as may sink it, so as the top of the Cork may swim
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61011:8"/> equal with the top of the Liquor, trying it in a Pail of Water, then tye a string to it, making a Hook in the middle of the top of the Cork to fix it to, and use it as hereafter mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Note, <hi>That in a Barrel of Beer there is</hi> 36 <hi>Gallons, and in Ale but</hi> 32.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The several Dimensions of Casks are as follows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Butt ought to be in length 50 Inches, the ledges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond each Head being one Inch, and one quarter of an Inch, which makes 2 Inches and an half, each Head being 3 quarters of an Inch thick, which amounts to 4 Inches in all, the which must be taken from the whole length, and the remainder is 46 Inches in length of Liquor. But you need have no respect to the length of the Liquor, but to the length of the Cask, for if the Butt be 50 Inches in length, and 31 Inches at the Bong, and 25 at the Head, the Cask is true.</p>
                  <p>Note, <hi>That the Dimensions of the following Caks must be taken to the outside of the Bong, and from the inside of the understaves, to the outside of the upper staves at the Head.</hi>

                  <p>The Rod which you are to use in taking these Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions must be at least four Foot long, divided into Inches and Quarters, with which Rod you are first to try the length, and then put your Rod streight down at the Bong, and if 23 and half appear at the outside of the Bong, the Barrel is right in that part; then apply the Rod to the Head, exactly in the middle, and if the outward Edge of the

               <p>A Canary Pipe is 116 and almost a half. A Brandy Hogshead is 57 and 1 third.</p>
               <p>To begin with him who understands Arithmetick, you are to take the several Dimensions of your Cask in manner following.</p>
               <p>First, Measure with your Rule (which must be at least 5 Foot long) the length of your Cask, and set down with your Pen how many Inches and Parts, then Measure how much the Staves go beyond the Heads, which I belive in a Hogshead may be one Inch and an half, which being double for both ends, amounts to 3 Inches; then for the thickness of each Head you may find by piercing of a hole and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a Nail, which must be made crooked at the Point; then when you have found the thickness of one Head, double it, and add the Sum to the 3 Inches the Ledges was beyond the Head, which I suppose to be in all 4 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61011:11"/> and an half; whch 4 and an half you must subduct from the whole length, and the remainder is the length of the Liquor, or of the Casks inside from head to head.</p>
               <p>Then put the Rule in at the Bong streight down to the bottom, and see how many Inches and Parts appear at the middle of the inside of the Bong, and set that down; in like manner apply your Rule to the Head, and observe how many Inches it is in Diameter from inside to inside, crossing the middle of the Head, and likwise set that down.</p>
               <p>When you have taken the Dimensions as before direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you are to Substract the Head from the Bong, and the Remainder Multiply by .7 adding the Product to the head Diameter, in manner following, that is, place the head Diameter one place towards the Left-hand further than the Product, then add them together, and prick off all the Figures to the Right-hand, except two, which two to the Left-hand beyond the Prick, is so many Inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and the rest to the Right is but so many parts of an Inch.</p>
               <p>Then you must Multiply this Number by itself, and the Product you must Divide by 231, or Multiply by .0043, and the Quotient or Product Multiply by the length, and the Product is how many Gallons and Parts is in the Cask if it be full, or how many Gallons of Wine the Cask will hold? observing always to prick off as many Figures to the Right-hand, as there is Figures prickt off to the Right, in both Multiplyer and Multiplicand.</p>

               <p>The Content of the foregoing Cask is just 85 Gallons, and almost one quarter of a Gallon, the first two Figures in the Decimal Parts to the Right-hand being of more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue by 10 times than all the rest; for as I said before, in Brewing, that 25 is the one quarter of a Gallon, and 50 the one half, and .75 the three quarters, so you see here that the Figures to the Right-hand is .24 Decimals, which does not want much of .25, the one quarter of a Gallon.</p>
               <p>The foregoing Rule you are to use in all Casks, only observe that you prick off so many Figures as there is in both the Numbers Multiplied, and for a Cask much Boulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Multiply by .75 instead of .7, and in case it be a Cask which is short and thick, in form of a hard Ware Cask, which is very rare to be found, you are to Multiply by .6 but the foregoing Multiplier .7 will serve for most Casks, if not all, used by Vintners.</p>
               <p>If it so fall out that you have a Cask part full, and would desire to know how much is in the Cask, and how much is drawn out, you must first know what the whole content of the Cask is, by the foregoing Rule, and then work according to the following Rule.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61011:12"/>
               <p>We shall suppose the Cask to be a Hogshead lying, whose content is 63 Gallons of Wine, the Bong Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it is 25 Inches, and there is of Liquor in the Cask 16 Inches; now to know how many Gallons of Wine is therein, you must add two Cyphers to the wet Inches, let them be what Number they will, and Divide the same by the Bong Diameter, observing that if the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be above half the Divisor, to add one more to the Quotient, and look for what Number you have in your Quotient in the following Table, and over-against it, and under V.S. you will find a Number, the which being found Multiply by the Content, and you have exactly how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gallons and Parts is in the Cask, the first two Figures to the Left-hand being the Gallons, and the rest you are to prick off for Parts.</p>

                  <p>You shall use the same Instrument for Wine, as you did for Ale, that is, a Rod about 5 Foot long, divided into Inches and quarters; but will have no occasion for the Cork, which is directed to be used in Ale, by reason there is no Yeast upon Wines, or Brandies.</p>

                  <head>To Gauge a Pipe of Wine.</head>
                  <p>A <hi>Canary</hi> Pipe contains 116 Gallons, tho' some say 120; but I have try'd the Content of some Pipes, and found it to be 116 and almost an half; but we shall here suppose it to 120 Gallons, and proceed in the work as follows.</p>
                  <p>Put your Rule in at the Bong, as aforesaid, and if the Wine Wet 28 Inches and three quarte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

If the Wine wet 19 Inches on the Rule, there is in the Cask 89 Gallons, and for every Inch is wanting thence downward for 4 Inches, there is 6 Gallons wanting of 89 Gallons; if 15 Inches be wet on the Rule, there is 65 Gallons in the Cask, and for every Inch it wants of wetting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

If it wet 12 Inches, there is 45 Gallons in the Cask; and if it wet 11 Inches, there is 39 Gallons and an half therein, and from thence down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for 2 Inches, there is for each Inch 5 Gallons and and an half wanting of 39 Gallons. If the Wine wet 9 Inches on the Rule, there is 28 Gallons, and for every Inch it wants thereof, for 3 Inches downward, there is 5 Gallons wanting of 28 Gallons. If the Wine wet 5 Inches on the Rule, there is 9 Gallons in the Cask; if it wet 4 Inches there is 6 Gallons; if it wet 3 Inches, there is 4 Gallons therein; and if it wet 2 Inches, there is 2 Gallons in the Pipe.</p>

                  <p>As to Tierces and Runlets, their Contents are so various, that there can be no certain Rule set down for the Gauging of them; only that if the Head Diameter of a Tierce be 16 Inches and a quarter, and the Bong 18 Inches and a quarter, and the length 34 and an half, the Tierce contains 42 Gallons.</p>
                  <p>If the Head Diameter of a Runlet be 15 Inches and 3 quarters, and the Bong 17 and a quarter, and length 31, the Content of the Runlet is 29 Gallons and an half.</p>

                  <head>To Gauge a <hi>Tun</hi> standing.</head>
                  <p>The Content of the Tun of Wine is 252 Gallons, and it is a Vessel very much used in the Distillery, both for Spirits and low-wines; Therefore I have set down a Table, by which you may know the <hi>Content</hi> of every Inch in depth, using it in the same manner as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Table for a Pipe.</p>
                  <p>Some distillers in the City of <hi>London</hi> weigh their Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels when full, which I look upon, and doubtless it is, a great trouble; it being none of my Business to doubt the exactness of it, here I shall insert what weight they allow to some quantities, and what weight they allow for the Cask.</p>
                  <p>For half an Hogshead, which is 31 Gallons and an Half, they allow two Hundred, one quarter and 11 Pound for Cask and Liquor, allowing one Quarter and 22 Pound for the Cask.</p>
                  <p>For a Punchion, they allow, Cask and Liquor, 6 Hundred, one Quarter, and 2 Pound.</p>
                  <p>For a <hi>Canary</hi> Pipe, 8 hundred, 2 quarters, and 17 Pound.</p>
                  <p>For a Butt or Pipe, holding 126 Gallons, they allow for Butt and Liquor 9 Hundred, one quarter and 17 Pound.</p>
                  <p>For a Hogshead they allow 4 Hundred, 2 Quarters, and 22 Pound.</p>
                  <p>This is but a vulgar and uncertain Estimation, for some Spirits are lighter than others; for the higher the Spirit, the lighter the Quantity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The following and foregoing Tables are grounded upon both Reason and Art; and if any Artist will be at the pains to try each Inch severally, he will find them so, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he must own that they are most useful.</hi>

                  <p>It will not be amiss to hint a little at such Measures as Tankards and Pots used in Publick Houses, I have taken the pains to Gauge a Pot and Tankard such as are commonly used, and find them to hold, according to the Rules of Gauging, 1.5 which is one Pint, and an half, so that I suppose there may be 6. of these in a Gallon, by

Now the Barrel of Beer is 36 Gallons, or 198 Pots, at two Pence a Pot, amounts to 1 l. 13 s. And so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably for a greater or lesser quantity; as a Pipe or Hogshead. A Pipe amounts, at two Pence a Pot, to 4 l. 19 s. And a Hogshead to 2 l. 9 s. 6 d. So the Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allers may soon compute whether they gain or loose, if they can but compute how many Barrels they sell a Week, one Week with another thro' the Year, and what Charges they are at in House-keeping, Servants Wages and House-rent, which may easily be done.</p>
                  <p>Suppose the Charge in House-keeping to be 20 Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a Week, and Servants Wages 4 Shillings a Week, House-Rent 26 Pound a Year, which is 10 Shillings a Week, all this amounts to one Pound 14 Shillings a Week. We shall suppose you pay to your Brewer for Beer <hi>per</hi> Barrel, 1 <hi>l.</hi> 2 <hi>s.</hi> and for Ale 19 <hi>s.</hi> The profit of a Barrel of Beer is 11 Shillings, and of a Barrel of Ale 10 Shillings; now you must either sell 2 Barrels of Beer, and as much of Ale <hi>per</hi> Week, or else you loose by your Trade. I shall say no more of this, but leave every Man to his own Humour, and shall return to my former business.</p>
                  <p>It is usual for Distillers to sell greater or lesser quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for uncertain Prizes, according as the Chapman and they can agree, therefore it will not be unnecessary to lay down a Method whereby they may know if the Price of the small quantity be agreed on, what the great quantity amounts to, or the contrary.</p>

                  <head>THE True ART OF <hi>Brewing</hi> Beer, Ale and Mum.</head>
                  <p>THere are many different Opinions concerning Brewing, and particularly in the Boyling of the Liquor of Worts, but I shall not trouble my self here to compose the difference of Men's Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therein, but shall treat of what natural Reason and my own Experience (by unwearied Travel and inspection therein) has taught me, as well in the <hi>Northern-parts</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as in the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>Western.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> You are to make your Water Boyl, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately abate your Fire insomuch that the Water may give over Boyling, letting it stand in the Copper, or rather draw it from thence into some well season'd wooden Vessel, for the space of one quarter of an hour, then wet your Malt therewith very stiff pouring it on by degrees; when you find that your Malt is all wet, stir it very well, and let it stand for half an hour, then pour the remaining part of the Liquor which you intend for the first Worts, on your Mash very gently, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61011:24"/> it up for two Hours, then put what quantity of Hops you think fit into your receiver and let your Worts run to them, letting it stand with the Hops in it one Hour; then strain it into your Cooler, and you have dore with your first Worts; then pour the full quantity of Liquor upon your Mash, according as you design your Beer or Ale to be in Strength, in a manner Boyling, stirring it very well, then let it stand covered as before for half an Hour, and let it run into your Receiver, then put all your Worts together into the Copper, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereto more Hops at pleasure, according to the Liquor you intend to Brew, whether it be Beer or Ale.</p>
                  <p>Let it Boyl for two Hours gently, then abate the Fire, and draw it out into the Coolers, straining the Hops there-from through a Basket for that purpose, and so you have done with preparing the Worts which is the first and greatest work.</p>
                  <p>The quantity of Hops you are to use for Ale is three Pound to 8 Bushels of Malt; if it be Beer, you put 6 Pound to 8 Bushel.</p>
                  <p>Take care your Vessels be kept very clean, or else they will turn Sower, and will prick the Worts, which will cause the Drink to turn Sower and Dead.</p>
                  <p>To prevent the Sowering of your Vessels, you are to wash them with warm Water, mixt with your Hops which you strain from the Wort.</p>
                  <p>When your Wort is Milk warm, put it into your Guile-Tun, and add thereto your Yeast, or Barm; and when it works over, beat it in very moderately, and often; when it is at the height of Working. Tun it into your Casks being well seasoned and clean, and it will still continue Working and Fine itself.</p>
                  <p>Double Ale or Beer is Brewed after the same manner of single, only instead of Water, you Mash with the first Worts upon fresh Malt.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have given you my Judgment of Brewing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61011:25"/> Ale and Beer, and shall only say two or three Words to the difference of Water.</p>
                  <p>Some are of opinion that River Water makes the best Drink, but to my knowledge there is a place in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> some 9 Miles from <hi>York,</hi> called <hi>Easingwood,</hi> and another place called <hi>Byland,</hi> that exceeds all <hi>Yorkshire</hi> for good and strong Ale. And tryal has been made with the same quantity of Malt made of the same Barly at one and the same time, and the same quantity of Water; the on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> being Brewed with River Water at <hi>York,</hi> and the other with Spring-water at <hi>Byland,</hi> the product of Worts was the same, and Brewed by the same Brewer, and yet the <hi>Byland</hi> Ale was both stronger, pleasanter and clearer than the other. The Spring proceeds from a Lime-stone, which Water I am confident is better than River Water.</p>
                  <p>Several other ways of Brewing read in a Book called Art's Treasury, Sold at the Ring in <hi>Little-Britain.</hi> Price one Shilling.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of making Cyder and other Liquors of Fruits, after the best and most profitable manner.</head>
               <p>THE first thing to be considered here is the Ripeness of the Fruit; There being much Cyder spoil'd in this Kingdom through using the Fruit before it be ripe, which yields but a Crab'd and sower Liquor; and will not keep so long as if the Fruit were ripe before it be used.</p>
               <p>This is occasioned by the Ignorance, and Covetousness of Men, who thinking to get all looses all; for when Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples falls from the Trees before ripe, by the wind or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, he is resolved he will make use of them, merely for the greater quantity of Liquor they produce, not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what a sower, Phlegmatick, and unhealthful Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor proceedes there-from, and how hurtful it is to the other good and ripe Fruit.</p>
               <p>Therefore I would advise that such Fruit as fall before ripe, be laid by till the time of their being ripe if they had been on the Tree; before you grind them, and to keep the Product of them by it self.</p>
               <p>When the Fruit is ripe which you may know by their fragrant smell, or Blackness of the seed or kernel, lay them in a dry place upon Oat-straw; for the space of 16 or 18 days; pick out all the Rotten or Bruised Apples from the sound, for they will give your Cyder a bad taste.</p>
               <p>When your Fruit is grinded it is proper you let the whole Mass stand a day or two, according to your Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency before you press it, for it will mightily help the Colour of the Cyder.</p>
               <p>If you have in the bottom of your Vessel some small
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61011:26"/> holes through which the fine Liquor will Distil into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, it will be much better then that which is prest.</p>
               <p>In pressing your Fruit I leave that to your own Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and Conveniency, the greatest loss that can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen thereby is only that some ways of pressing produces less Liquor then others.</p>
               <p>Gather all the Liquor, as it comes from the press into some convenient large Vessel, straining it through a strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er therein, when so done throw a Cloath over it and let it stand and Ferment,</p>
               <p>In order to its Fermentation you are to keep it warm, by warm Cloaths, or otherwise, for that will be a great help to the speedy and well Fermenting of it; the way of Fermenting of it must be thus. Take four or five Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Isinglass,</hi> and beat it very well upon an Anvil, put it into three or four Quarts of warm Cyder, let it stand in a warm place for three or four days, till it turn to a Jelly, then put a Gallon of Cyder, and mix it with this Jelly very well, and put it altogether into your Vessel, stiring it very well with a Staff, and in a day or two it will be fit for to put into such Vessels as you design to keep it in all the year; taking care before you draw it into these Vessels, to take off a sort of skim, which will lie on the surface of the Liquor.</p>
               <p>When the Liquor is thus well Fined and Purified, and put into such Casks as you find convenient; leaving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no more Lees than is necessary for its Preservation, it will keep a long time: But observe that your Casks be well season'd.</p>
               <p>Take care you do not fill your Casks too full, but leave room for the Cyder to finish its Fermentation; but if it will Ferment no more, and you design to keep it long, put into a Hogshead thereof, a quart of unground Wheat, or a small quantity of the New Lees of Canary, and then Bung it up, and leave a small Vent-hole, with a loose Peg, therein, for there is a wild Spirit in all such Liquors which will often force a Vent.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Concerning Distillation of Spirits and Brandies from Malt.</head>
               <p>THE Common way used by the best distillers in <hi>Holland,</hi> and other parts, is as follow, <hi>viz.</hi> They first make their Liquor or Water almost Boyl, and pour it upon the Malt, in a convenient Vessel for that use, so that it may just wet the Malt, when it is wet so much as is requisite, they row, or stir it very well for the space of an Hour, then they cover it up and let it stand for two Hours; then they let it off into the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61011:32"/> Receivers, and pour on more Liquor, and let it stand about an Hour, and in like manner a third time; when they have thus done, and convey'd all the Worts into the Wash-Backs, they Ferment it with Barm, for two or three Days, keeping it from Working over the Backs, by often beating it in, observing to take off the Barm before it Work itself Flat, or else the Yeast will fall to Bottom and damnify the Wash, let it stand for use in the Back till it be a Medium between Sower and Sweet.</p>
               <p>They draw it out of their Backs into the Still by a Pump, filling the Still above half full, observing to keep working of the Back all the while, so that it may be equally mixt; when so done they shut the Still; and by a good fire, set it a Boyling; they then Lute the Still with the Whites of Eggs and Barly Floor: If the Malt be good, the first two or three Cans will be proof Spirits, which needs no more distillation. Then they proceed (the low Wines being all drawn, and has stood 8 or 9 Days) to Distillation of Spirits, which they do in the same manner as they do for the Low-Wines, and if they intend to have it double Rectify'd, they draw it a Third time.</p>
               <p>The common quantity drawn from a Quarter of good Malt, is three Barrels of Wash; and from thence your Product of Low-Wines will be thirty six or thirty eight Gallons, which will yield some fourteen Gallons of proof Spirits.</p>

                  <p>Make your Liquor, or Water Blood warm, and put to 40 Gallons of the said Liquor, a Hundred Weight of Molasses, stir them well together, for the space of 2 or 3 Hours, till the whole is dissolved, then put it into your Copper, putting therein a sufficient quantity of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61011:33"/> Barm; Nutmegs and Cinnamon, according to the Discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Distiller, the intent of the things being only for a Flavor: when you have so done, clap on the Head while the Liquor is yet warm, and let it stand twenty four Hours well Luted, then let it run into the Receiver, and put your Barm therein, and let it Work very well, beating it in Four or Five times a Day, for two Days, then let it stand Four or Five Days and it is an Excellent Liquor for Drinking, or Distillation.</p>

                     <p>I am apt to think that if 2 or 3 Spoonfuls of Brandy, and a little Loaf-Sugar were put into it. would make it still better.</p>

                     <hi>Tryon</hi>'s Way of Brewing Ale and Beer.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First</hi> LET your Water be Pure Clear River Water, because River Water is Richest in Spirit, and Fatter than Fountain, Well, or Pond Water, which by standing, are apt to loose their Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Put good Malt and Hops into the Mash-fat, and your whole quantity of Water, whether put in at once, or at two several times, let be but just scalding-hot upon them, and then stir them well together, and let them stand so long as till the Water extracts the Virtue from the Malt and Hops, and then draw your Wort off. If
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61011:36"/> cold Water would draw out the Virtue of Malt and Hops, it would be better, but it will not, therefore scalding must be used. Boyl not your Hops, for thereby the Balsamick, and Fragrant Oyl and Spirit is lost: This you may observe in other Herbs, as Tea, and the like, which they do not boyl, but pour scalding-hot Liquor on it, which makes it more Fragrant, and hinders its becoming Flat, Dispirited, and unpleasant in Taste.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Boyl not your Wort after it's made, for that adds nothing to the Quantity, but lessens its pure Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samick Virtue and Goodness. If you say you boyl the Wort to lessen the Watry Parts, that you may remedy by putting less Water or so much the more Ingredients. If you say without this boyling Ale or Beer will not keep, you mistake, for all liquid things keep long, or decay, according to the quantity of Spirit that is in them; and by reason boyling diminishes that Spirit, 'tis manifest so much the sooner the Drink will decay, and grow Sour, or Hard, and this I impute chiefly to the boyling. If you say boyl'd Beer will keep 8 or 9 Years, that is true, but that proceeds from the vast quantity of the Malt and Hops that is in it, not from its boyling, for boyling will not preserve it a quarter so long if it wants a due proportion for that 9 Years keeping of Mault &amp; Hops. So it is that indeed, which does effect the work; Excellent pure Ale I have drank at a House in <hi>York-shire,</hi> as clear as White-wine and as strong; I thought it to be about 3 Weeks old, and it was 14 Months old and the partysaid it would keep as many more in that goodness, the which was imputed to the quantity and goodness of the Malt they put in it; for, (said the Party) put in but half the Malt and it will not keep a quarter so long, the party told me he never boyl'd his Worts because boyling diminished the Spirits and weakened the Liquor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In Working, let the quantity of your Yeast be according to the proportion and quantity of the Liquor, and let it not be wrought upto hot, but as cool as possible to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61011:37"/> be done; by this means the Fermentation will be gentle and naturally and the Drink keep longer; and being thus gently performed it will cease of its own accord when it comes to a Fineness, whereas being too hot it will cause a violent Fermentation, loose its Balsamick Spirituous quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and quickly grow Hard, or Eager, and Sower, and the longer this violent Fermentation continues, by so much the more its weaken'd and turns Sower.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The time of Working being over, the Vessels containing the Drink should be very cool, that the Air may not easily penetrate, because heat is apt to put all Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Liquors on the Fret which produces Staleness and Sourness. The time of keeping any Liquor of this kind is according to its strength in Malt, and Tincture of the Hops; Coolness, and Quietness, ought to be minded, for great Knocks cause Fretting as that of Coaches, Carts, Thunder, Lightning, Drums, Canons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cause Fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Sours the Drink as well as the heat of the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Air, so that coolness and quietness is very requisite to the place you keep your Drink in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Age I cannot determine; for that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quantity and strength of the Spirit its En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with; new Liquors, if once Fine, are wholsomer than old and stale; and therefore being once Fine, tho' never so new are fit to Drink. Mild Drink if Fine opens obstructions, purifies the Blood, keeps the Body soluble, and because of the Hops is Dicretick, good against Stone, Sand or Gravel, Ale is good for Consumptions makes lean Folks fat. Beer strong of the Hop is good against Gout, Scurvy, Dropsy and Stone.</p>
